# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Basic Idea
It is sometimes hard to conceptualize what exactly are algorithms doing, so having visualizations are often very helpful. So this program will be implementing several sorting in Python using the Pygame library to help us visualize these sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithm (In Progress)

### Bubble Sort

### Selection Sort
