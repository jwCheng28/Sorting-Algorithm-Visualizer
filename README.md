# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Basic Idea
It is sometimes hard to conceptualize what exactly are algorithms doing, so having visualizations are often very helpful. So this program will be implementing several sorting in Python using the Pygame library to help us visualize these sorting algorithms. Currently the sorting algorithms that are implemented are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. There are previews of the visualization of each sorting algorithm provided below (Beware that some of them are sped up).

## How to Use
This visualization is written in Python 3, so be sure to have python installed.

After having python installed, simply clone the repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the command line; then you can run the script with `python main.py`. 

After runnning the python script you'll be loaded in to a blank canvas in pygame. Use the following commands to see the sorts.
- Press the 'spacebar' to load the screen, or re-randomize the bars.
- Press 'b' to see Bubble Sort
- Press 's' to see Selection Sort
- Press 'm' to see Merge Sort
- Press 'c' to see Cocktail Sort
- Press 'g' to see Gnome Sort
- Press 'q' to quit the program
